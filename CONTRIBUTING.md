## Saving and Pulling Changes

Once you make changes, you can upload (commit/push) your changes.

If any changes are made on this repository, you also need to pull/sync the changes.

1. (Recommended) Using the VSCode GUI: On the left side of the screen, there is a button that says `Source Control`. Open the screen. You can write a commit message and push.

2. Using the Git CLI: there are two ways to do this: you can commit them by running `git add .`, `git commit -m "Your message here"`, and `git push` in the terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have to run the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) to commit/pull your changes

> [!TIP]
> It is recommended for you to learn how to write good git commit messages.
