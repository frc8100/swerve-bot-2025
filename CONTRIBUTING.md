# Contributing

This repository is open to contributions. If you would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines below.

## Getting Started

There are two main ways to get started with this code. For each of them, you will need to have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The first way is to code on your own computer.

1. Install the above software.
2. Open Visual Studio Code.
3. Press `Ctrl+\`` to open the terminal.
4. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/frc8100/swerve-bot-2025.git` in the terminal.
  - You could alternatively clone the repository using VSCode's built-in Git functionality.
5. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
6. Install the recommended extensions (if you haven't already).
7. You can now start coding.


The second way is to open it on Github Codespaces. This is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code in the cloud.

1. Open the repository on Github. (You're already here!)
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. Click on "Open with Codespaces".
4. Wait for the environment to load.
5. Install the recommended extensions (if you haven't already).
6. You can now start coding.

Once you make changes, you can commit them by running `git add .`, `git commit -m "Your message here"`, and `git push` in the terminal, or by using the built-in Git functionality in Visual Studio Code.

For more details on source control, see [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).
